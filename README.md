# Calculator Project

A simple terminal calculator built in Python as part of my programming learning journey.
This project focuses on developing programming logic, conditional structures, functions, loops, input validation, and basic error handling while also practicing Git and GitHub workflows.

## How to Run

Make sure Python 3 is installed on your system.

Run the following command in the terminal:

~~~bash
python calculator.py
~~~

## Concepts Applied

Programming Logic and Conditionals
- Arithmetic operations using if, elif, and else
- Decision-making structures based on user input

Functions
- Code organization using def
- Separation of responsibilities inside the program

Loops
- Continuous program execution using while True
- Ability to perform multiple calculations without restarting

Error Handling
- try and except blocks
- ValueError handling for invalid input
- Protection against division by zero

Data Input
- input() for user interaction
- float() and int() for data conversion
- Basic input normalization using strip() and lower()

Version Control
- Git commits
- Project evolution tracking
- Repository organization for portfolio use
